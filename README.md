# SQL Crash Course

## Bite-sized SQL lessons for data analysts.

BASED ON: Hylia is a lightweight [Eleventy](https://11ty.io) starter kit with [Netlify CMS](https://www.netlifycms.org/) pre-configured, so that you can one-click install a progressive, accessible blog in minutes. It also gives you a well organised starting point to extend it for yourself.


## SQL Quiz component.

This is largely inspired by the sterling work of other SQL online tutorial developers, mainly:

https://github.com/GKhalsa/sql-fun-time

And many others who blazed the trail.

## Lesson content.

All lessons and quiz questions are by Alan Hylands, a data analyst and author of the [AlanHylands.com](https://alanhylands.com) blog
