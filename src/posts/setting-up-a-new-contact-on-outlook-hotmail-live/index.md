In this article we are going to cover the steps you will need to complete to add a new email address as a Contact on your Outlook, Hotmail or Live email account.

This may be because Microsoft (who operate all of those websites) have been blocking emails from certain websites that you would like to receive.

For example, maybe you are a member of a fitness studio who are trying to send you emails showing confirmations of class bookings you have made on their website or an online store sending you notifications of a new shirt you wanted coming back into stock.

By adding the email address they send the emails from as a Contact you should have a better chance of seeing those emails lands in your Inbox rather than disappear into the email Bermuda Triangle.

## STEP 1: LOG-IN TO YOUR EMAIL ACCOUNT

I won't screenshot this as you should know how to get here. I am using my own Hotmail account on a desktop monitor to demonstrate this so it may look a little different on a phone or tablet app but the general actions should be very similar.

## STEP 2: CLICK ON THE CONTACTS ICON

In the screenshot below I have pointed a big red arrow at the Contacts icon on the bottom left of the main Outlook.Live.com screen. It looks a little like two heads and shoulders, one bigger, one slightly smaller. Click on this now to enter the Contacts management screen.

## STEP 3: CLICK ON THE NEW CONTACT BUTTON

You can see the "+ New contact" button with the big red arrow beside it below on the screenshot. The upside down hat beside it shows there is a dropdown list which, when clicked, gives us two options: 1) New contact or 2) New contact list. Click on the New contact option.

## STEP 4: FILL IN THE NEW CONTACT DETAILS

A screen will pop up (as below) with areas for you to fill in the First Name, Surname, Email Address, Mobile Phone Number, Company etc. of the new contact you are looking to add.

We only really need to add a name to identify the new contact and the email address we want to show that we know and trust so that the emails can get delivered to us.

In my example below, I have added the name as Cura Fitness and the email address as team@curafitness.com:

![Click Create button](/images/content/wphot4.jpg)

You should put in the details that correspond to the new contact you are looking to add then click the Create button at the bottom of the screen (see big red arrow).

## STEP 5: SIT BACK AND WAIT FOR YOUR EMAILS TO ARRIVE

You've done it! Now it's down to the email sender to send you over their latest newsletter, product info or booking confirmation which should be delivered straight into your inbox ready for reading.
