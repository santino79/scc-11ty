## What is SQL Crash Course all about?

This course has a simple mission to help anyone looking to learn SQL, or brush up on their SQL skills.

It's completely free to use, but if you want to use any of the material or lessons elsewhere please drop me a note on the contact details below as a courtesy.

Even better, if you use the SQL lessons here to help you bag a data analyst job, or even a promotion at your current job, I'd love to hear about it and add it to our list of testimonials. These really help other folks overcome their fear of getting started learning SQL and are a great hep to the data community. The more the merrier I say!

## Who put these lessons together?

My name is **Alan Hylands** and I am a data analyst and writer from Northern Ireland. I've worked in tech, data and analytics for the past 20+ years - building, reporting, analysing, managing, and mentoring.

I have worked in tech, financial services, healthcare, and e-commerce, and have led successful data projects in areas such as exploratory data analysis, customer segmentation and profiling, and customer lifetime value modelling.


## What I'm doing now.

I currently work as a Staff Data Scientist for tech company [Zapier](https://zapier.com).
